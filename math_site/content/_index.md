I'm an undergraduate student beginning to think about math grad school. In addition to my math courses, I've been doing some self-study work and have been finding it helpful to write small explanations of the various topics I come across. These explanations are collected on this site as my own personal math wiki. 

I'm currently wrapping up my junior year, and am working on putting together some wikis mostly on topology with some algebraic geometry as a means of studying.
