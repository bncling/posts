## Definitions
A [topological space]({{< ref topology_def.md >}}) $(X,\T)$ is **path connected** if and only if for all $p,q \in X$ there exists a [path]({{< ref paths.md >}}) from $p$ to $q$. 

## Properties
[Theorem 8.35:](\work.pdf#page=114) All path connected spaces are [connected]({{< ref connectedness.md >}}). 

[Theorem 8.38:](\work.pdf#page=115) The [product]({{< ref cartesian.md >}}) of path connected spaces with the [product topology]({{< ref product_topology.md >}}) is path connected. 

## Examples
The [closure]({{< ref closure.md >}}) of the [topologist's sine curve]({{< ref top_sine.md >}}) is connected but not path connected. 

Every nonempty [open set]({{< ref open_sets.md >}}) in $\R^n$ with the [standard topology]({{< ref standard_topology.md >}}) that is connected is path connected.
