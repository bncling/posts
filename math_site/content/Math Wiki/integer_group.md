## Definition
The set of integers, $\Z$, together with the operation addition forms an infinite [group]({{< ref groups.md >}}).

## Properties
The group is [cyclic]({{< ref cyclic.md >}}) generated by $\pm 1$, and [abelian]({{< ref abelian.md >}}) since addition is commutative.

Every [subgroup]({{< ref subgroups.md >}}) of $\Z$ has the form $n\Z = \langle n \rangle = \{nz \mid z \in \Z\}$ for some $n \in \Z$.
