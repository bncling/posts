## Definition
A [topological space]({{< ref topology_def.md >}}) is an **$n$-manifold** if an only if it is a [separable]({{< ref separable_spaces.md >}}), [metrizable]({{< ref metric_spaces.md >}}) space in which every point has a [neighborhood]({{< ref open_sets.md >}}) that is [homeomorphic]({{< ref homeomorphisms.md >}}) to an open ball in $\R^n$ with the [standard topology]({{< ref standard_topology.md >}}).

## Properties
Because manifolds are metrizable, they are also [1<sup>st</sup> countable]({{< ref first_countable.md >}}), [Hausdorff]({{< ref hausdorff.md >}}), [regular]({{< ref regular.md >}}), and [normal ]({{< ref normal.md >}}).

[Theorems 11.25-11.27:](\work.pdf#page=125) A space $M$ is a [compact]({{< ref compactness.md >}}), [connected]({{< ref connectedness.md >}}), [triangulable]({{< ref triangulations.md >}}) 2-manifold if and only if $M$ is homeomorphic to a [polygonal presentation]({{< ref polygonal_presentations.md >}}). 

[Theorem 11.37:](\work.pdf#page=140) Any compact, connected, triangulable 2-manifold is homeomorphic to $\Sp^2$, a [connected sum]({{< ref connected_sums.md >}}) of tori, or a connected sum of projective planes. 

## Examples
The **$n$-sphere** $\Sp^n$ is any space homeomorphic to the set of all points a distance of $1$ away from the origin in $\Rs^{n+1}$. 

The **torus** is the surface of a donut, and is homeomorphic to $\Sp^1 \times \Sp^1$. 

**Real projective $n$-space** $\RP^n$ is the set of all lines through the origin in $\R^n$ with the topology generated by the [basis]({{< ref top_basis.md >}}) consisting of sets of lines that define open double cones with points meeting at the origin. $\RP^n$ is homeomorphic to the space $\Sp^n / \langle x \sim -x \rangle$, the $n$-sphere with antipodal points identified.
