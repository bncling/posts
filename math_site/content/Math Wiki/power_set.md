## Definition
Let $A$ be a set. Its **power set**, denoted $2^A$, is the set of all subsets of $A$. 

## Properties
[Theorem 1.18:](\work.pdf#page=5) If the set $A$ is finite, then its power set has [cardinality]({{< ref cardinality.md >}}) $\vert 2^A \vert = 2^{\vert A \vert}$. 

[Theorem 1.19:](\work.pdf#page=5) For any set $A$, there exists an [injection]({{< ref inj_surj_bij.md >}}) from $A$ into $2^A$. 

[Theorem 1.20:](\work.pdf#page=5) The cardinality of $2^A$ is the same as the cardinality of the set of all [functions]({{< ref function.md >}}) $f: A \to \{0,1\}$.

[Theorem 1.22:](\work.pdf#page=6) For all sets $A$, there does not exist a [surjection]({{< ref inj_surj_bij.md >}}) $f: A \to 2^A$.
