## Definition
The set of [equivalence classes]({{< ref equiv_rels.md >}}) on $\Z$ modulo $n$ forms a finite [group]({{< ref groups.md >}}).

## Properties
The group is [cyclic]({{< ref cyclic.md >}}) generated by the equivalence classes of numbers [relatively prime]({{< ref coprime.md >}}) to $n$, and [abelian]({{< ref abelian.md >}}) since addition of equivalence classes is commutative.
