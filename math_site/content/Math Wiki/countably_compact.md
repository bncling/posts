Similar to being compact, but weaker...

## Definition
A [topological space]({{< ref topology_def.md >}}) $(X, \T)$ is **countably compact** if and only if every [countable]({{< ref cardinality.md >}}) [open cover]({{< ref compactness.md >}}) has a finite subcover. 

## Properties
[Theorem 6.25:](\work.pdf#page=58) If, in addition to being countably compact, a space $X$ is [Lindelöf]({{< ref lindelöf.md >}}), $X$ is also [compact]({{< ref compactness.md >}}).

[Theorem 6.26:](\work.pdf#page=58) If $X$ is a [$T_1$ space]({{< ref t1.md >}}), $X$ is countably compact if and only if all infinite subsets of $X$ have [limit points]({{< ref limit_points.md >}}). 

[Theorem 6.29:](\work.pdf#page=61) If $A$ is a [closed]({{< ref closed_sets.md >}}) subset of a countably compact space $X$, then $A$ is countably compact.
