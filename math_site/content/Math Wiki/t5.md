## Definition
Let $(X, \T)$ be a [topological space]({{< ref topology_def.md >}}). It is $T_5$ if and only if it is both [$T_1$]({{< ref t1.md >}}) and [completely normal]({{< ref completely_normal.md >}}).

## Properties
[Theorem 4.7:](\work.pdf#page=31) If a space $(X, \T)$ is $T_5$, it is also completely normal by definition, [normal]({{< ref normal.md >}}) since disjoint closed sets are separated,  [$T_3$]({{< ref t3.md >}}), regular, [Hausdorff]({{< ref hausdorff.md >}}), and [$T_1$]({{< ref t1.md >}}).
