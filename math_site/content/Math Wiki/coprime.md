## Definition
Two numbers $a,b \in \N$ are said to be **coprime** or **relatively prime** if their [greatest common divisor]({{< ref gcd.md >}}) is 1. 

## Properties
Because the gcd of two numbers $a$ and $b$ can always be written as an integral [linear combination]({{< ref linear_combo.md >}}) of $a$ and $b$, there always exist $s,t \in \Z$ such that $as + bt = 1$ if and only if $a$ and $b$ are coprime.
