## Definition
A [subgroup]({{< ref subgroups.md >}}) $H$ of a [group]({{< ref groups.md >}}) $(G,\cdot)$ is said to be **normal**, written $H \triangleleft G$, if and only if its left and right [cosets]({{< ref grp_cosets.md >}}) are equal. That is, if and only if $gH = Hg$ for all $g \in G$. 

## Properties
**Proposition:** The following are equivalent.

- $H \triangleleft G$;
- $gH = Hg$ for all $g \in G$;
- $gHg\inv = H$ for all $g \in G$;
- $gHg\inv \subset H$ for all $g \in G$.

For any group $G$, the entire group, its [center]({{< ref grp_center.md >}}), and the trivial subgroup $\{e\}$ are always normal in $G$. 

Any subgroup of an [abelian group]({{< ref abelian.md >}}) is normal, and any subgroup with [index]({{< ref grp_cosets.md >}}) $2$ is normal. 

If $N$ is normal in $G$, then $N$ is the [kernel]({{< ref grp_morph.md >}}) of the homomorphism $\pi: G \to$ [$G/N$]({{< ref quotient_groups.md >}}), called the **quotient map**, defined by $\pi(g) = gN$.

## Examples
In the [dihedral]({{< ref dihedral.md >}}) group $D_n$, the [cyclic subgroup]({{< ref cyclic.md >}}) generated by the rotation $r$ is normal, but the subgroup $\{\id, (1\,2)\}$ is not.
