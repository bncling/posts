## Definition
The **Klein four-group** is a [group]({{< ref groups.md >}}) that can be thought of in many ways, one of which is as the [external direct product]({{< ref grp_edp.md >}}) $\Z_2 \times \Z_2$, and is typically denoted by $V$.

## Properties
The group is [abelian]({{< ref abelian.md >}}).

Every non-identity element has order $2$.

## Examples
The group can also be thought of as being given by the [group presentation]({{< ref grp_presentations.md >}}) $\langle a,b \mid a^2, b^2, (ab)^2 \rangle$.

Alternatively, the group can be thought of as the [subgroup]({{< ref subgroups.md >}}) of the [general linear group]({{< ref gen_linear.md >}}) $GL_2(\R)$ given by $$V = \left\{ \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix} \right\}.$$
