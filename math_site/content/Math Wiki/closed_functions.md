## Definition
A [function]({{< ref function.md >}}) $f: X \to Y$ for [topological spaces]({{< ref topology_def.md >}}) $X$ and $Y$ is called **closed** if and only for every [closed set]({{< ref closed_sets.md >}}) $A \subset X$, the image $f(A)$ is closed in $Y$. 

## Properties
[Theorem 7.21:](\work.pdf#page=68) If $X$ is [normal]({{< ref normal.md >}}) and $f: X \to Y$ is [continuous]({{< ref continuity.md >}}), [surjective]({{< ref inj_surj_bij.md >}}), and closed, then $Y$ is normal.
