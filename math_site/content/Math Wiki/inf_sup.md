## Definitions
Let $A \subset \mathbb{R}$. 

- We say $c \in \mathbb{R}$ is an **upper bound** of $A$ if and only if $c \geq a$ for all $a \in A$. 
- We say $c \in \mathbb{R}$ is a **lower bound** of $A$ if and only if $c \leq a$ for all $a \in A$. 
- We say $c \in \mathbb{R}$ is the **greatest/largest/maximum element** of $A$ if and only if $c$ is an upper bound of $A$ and $c \in A$.
- We say $c \in \mathbb{R}$ is the **least/smallest/minimum element** of $A$ if and only if $c$ is a lower bound of $A$ and $c \in A$. 
- We say $A$ is **bounded above** if and only if it has an upper bound, that it is **bounded below** if and only if it has a lower bound, and that it is **bounded** if and only if it has an upper bound and a lower bound. 
- We say $c \in \mathbb{R}$ is the **supremum** of $A$ if and only if it is the least upper bound of $A$.
- We say $c \in \mathbb{R}$ is the **infimum** of $A$ if and only if it is the greatest lower bound of $A$. 

## Properties
- Bounded does not mean finite. 
- Maxima and minuma of subsets need not exist.
- Suprema and infima of subsets need not exist or be contained in the subset if they do exist.

## Examples
- $\mathbb{N}$, $\mathbb{Z}$, $\mathbb{Q}$, and $\mathbb{R}$ are all unbounded (that is, not bounded).
- The sets $\mathbb{Q} \cap [0, \sqrt{2}]$ and $(0,1)$ have no maximum elements, but they have suprema $\sqrt{2}$ and $1$, respectively.
