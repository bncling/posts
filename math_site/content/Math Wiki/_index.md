This is a collection of several brief explanations of various math concepts / objects I've come across, organized into one nice central location for my own use. 

In pages with the [topology tag]({{< ref "/tags/topology" >}}), there are sometimes references to theorems, lemmas, and exercises from the book *Topology Through Inquiry* by Michael Starbird and Francis Su that I've been working with this summer. The theorems that are referenced in these pages are (usually) ones that I've proven (or at least tried to prove---no guarantees all the proofs work), and you can find a compilation of all the work I've done [here]({{< ref top_selfstudy.md >}}).

The collection is currently organized to have the latest updated pages at the top, but I might be looking to change that at some point.
