Basically what the name makes it sound like. Similar in definition to the [countable complement topology]({{< ref countable_complement_topology.md >}}).

## Definition
Let $X$ be a set. A set $U$ is in the **finite complement topology** if and only if $X - U$ is finite or if $U = \emptyset$. This [topology]({{< ref topology_def.md >}}) is also called the **cofinite** topology.

## Properties
Finite sets are closed in the finite complement topology.
