# Countable complement topology
Basically what the name makes it sound like. It's similar in definition to the [finite complement topology]({{< ref finite_complement_topology.md >}}).

### Definition
Let $X$ be a set. A set $U$ is in the **countable complement topology** if and only if $X - U$ is [countable]({{< ref infty_sizes.md >}}) or if $U = \emptyset$. This [topology]({{< ref topology_def.md >}}) is also called the **cocountable** topology.

### Properties
Countable sets are closed in this topology.
