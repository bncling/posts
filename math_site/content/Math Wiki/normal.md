## Definition
Let $(X, \T)$ be a [topological space]({{< ref topology_def.md >}}). It is **normal** if and only if for every pair of disjoint, [closed sets]({{< ref closed_sets.md >}}) $A$ and $B$, there are disjoint [open sets]({{< ref open_sets.md >}}) $U$ and $V$ such that $A \subset U$ and $B \subset V$.

## Properties
If a space $(X, \T)$ is [$T_4$]({{< ref t4.md >}}), it is also normal by definition.

Being normal does not necessarily imply being [$T_3$]({{< ref t3.md >}}), [regular]({{< ref regular.md >}}), [Hausdorff]({{< ref hausdorff.md >}}), or [$T_1$]({{< ref t1.md >}}).
