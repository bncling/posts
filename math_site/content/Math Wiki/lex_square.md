Sets have interesting closures.

## Definition
The unit square $[0,1] \times [0,1]$ is totally ordered by the [lexicographic order]({{< ref orderings.md >}}), and the **lexicographically ordered square** is the [topological space]({{< ref topology_def.md >}}) formed from the unit square together with the associated [order topology]({{< ref order_topology.md >}}). 

## Properties
Many sets have very interesting, unexpected closures. See [Exercise 3.21](\work.pdf#page=24).
