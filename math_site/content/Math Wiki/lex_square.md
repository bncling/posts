Sets have interesting closures.

## Definition
The unit square $[0,1] \times [0,1]$ is totally ordered by the [lexicographic order]({{< ref orderings.md >}}), and the **lexicographically ordered square** is the [topological space]({{< ref topology_def.md >}}) formed from the unit square together with the associated [order topology]({{< ref order_topology.md >}}). 

## Properties
Many sets have very interesting, unexpected closures. See [Exercise 3.21](\work.pdf#page=24).

#### Separation Properties
- [$T_1$-space]({{< ref t1.md >}})
- [Hausdorff]({{< ref hausdorff.md >}})
- [Regular]({{< ref regular.md >}}) and a [$T_3$-space]({{< ref t3.md >}})

These follow from the fact that this is a space with an [order topology]({{< ref order_topology.md >}}).

#### Countability Properties
- **Not** [separable]({{< ref separable_spaces.md >}})
- **Not** [2<sup>nd</sup> countable]({{< ref second_countable.md >}})
