# Sequences
An infinite list of things.

### Definitions
For [real numbers]({{< ref real_numbers.md >}}), a **sequence** is a function $f: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$, where the image of the number $n$ under $f$ is typically called $a_n$. The sequence is written by listing its images: $a_1, a_2, \dots$ or for short, $\{a_n\}$.

In a [topological space]({{< ref topology_def.md >}}) $(X, \mathcal{T})$, a **sequence** is a function $f: \mathbb{N} \to X$, where the image of the number $i$ under $f$ is typically called $x_i$. The sequence is written by listing its images: $x_1, x_2, \dots$ or for short, $(x_i)_{i \in \mathbb{N}}$.
