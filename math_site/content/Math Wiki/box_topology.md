Another, weirder topology on an [infinite product]({{< ref cartesian.md >}}).

## Definition
Let $\{(X_\alpha, \T_\alpha)\}_{\alpha \in \lambda}$ be a (possibly infinite) collection of [topological spaces]({{< ref topology_def.md >}}). The **box topology** on the product $\prod_{\alpha \in \lambda} X_\alpha$ is the topology generated by a basis consisting of sets of the form $\prod_{\alpha \in \lambda} U_\alpha$ where $U_\alpha$ is open in $(X_\alpha, \T_\alpha)$ for each $\alpha$.

## Properties
As a consequence of [Theorem 3.27](\work.pdf#page=28), if the collection $\{(X_\alpha, \T_\alpha)\}_{\alpha \in \lambda}$ is finite, the box topology on $\prod_{\alpha \in \lambda} X_\alpha$ is the same as the [product topology]({{< ref product_topology.md >}}).

## Examples
The box topology on the set $2^\N = \prod_{n \in \N} \{0,1\}$ where each copy of $\{0,1\}$ comes with the [discrete topology]({{< ref discrete_topology.md >}}) is itself the discrete topology on $2^\N$ since the singleton containing an arbitary element of $2^\N$ (that is, the singleton containing a binary [sequence]({{< ref sequence.md >}}), $\{(a_n)_{n \in \N}\}$ where $a_n \in \{0,1\}$) is open. To see this, note that the singleton $U_n = \{a_n\}$ is open in $\{0,1\}$ with the discrete topology, so the set $\prod_{n \in \N} U_n = \prod_{n \in \N} \{a_n\}$ is a basic open set in the box topology. Since singletons are open in $2^\N$ with the box topology, this space is the discrete space. This is an example of an instance in which the box topology and [product topology]({{< ref product_topology.md >}}) differ since $2^\N$ with the product topology is not the same as $2^\N$ with the discrete topology.
