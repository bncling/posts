# Continuity
Continuous functions can be drawn without picking up your pencil. 

### The $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ definition, limit related definition
A [function]({{< ref function.md >}}) $f: \mathcal{D} \to \mathbb{R}$ is **continuous at a point $c \in \mathcal{D}$** if and only if the [limit]({{< ref limits.md >}}) of $f$ at $c$ exists and $\lim \limits_{x \to c} f(x) = f(c)$.
A function $f: \mathcal{D} \to \mathbb{R}$ is **continuous** if and only if it is continuous at the point $c$ for all $c \in \mathcal{D}$. 

### Examples
- Every rational function is continuous at every point in its domain.
- [Thomae's function]({{< ref thomae.md >}}) is continuos at every irrational point and [discontinuous]({{< ref discontinuities.md >}}) at every rational point.
