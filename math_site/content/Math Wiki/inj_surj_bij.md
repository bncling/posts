## Definitions
A [function]({{< ref function.md >}}) or map $f: \mathcal{D} \to \mathcal{C}$ is called **injective** if and  only if for all $a,b \in \mathcal{D}$ such that $a \neq b$, we have that $f(a) \neq f(b)$.

It is called **surjective** if and only if for all $y \in \mathcal{C}$, there exists an $x \in \mathcal{D}$  such that $f(x) = y$. 

It is called **bijective** if and only if it is both injective and surjective.
