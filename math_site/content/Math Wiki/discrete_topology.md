# The discrete topology
The **discrete topology** is the [finest]({{< ref fine_coarse.md >}}) [topology]({{< ref topology_def.md >}}) on a given set. A set together with the discrete topology is called a **discrete space**.

## Definition
Let $X$ be a set. Then the discrete topology on $X$ contains all subsets of $X$, that is, the topology is $\mathcal{T} = 2^X$, the power set of $X$. 

## Properties
If $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is a topological space, then it is a discrete space if and only if all singletons are open. 

All sets in the discrete topology are both [closed]({{< ref closed_sets.md >}}) and [open]({{< ref open_sets.md >}}).
