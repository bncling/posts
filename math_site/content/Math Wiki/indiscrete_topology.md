The [coarsest]({{< ref fine_coarse.md >}}) possible [topology]({{< ref topology_def.md >}}) on a set $X$. 

## Definition
Let $X$ be a set. The **indiscrete topology** is $\mathcal{T} = \{\emptyset, X\}$. The topological space $(X, \{\emptyset, X\})$ is called an **indiscrete space**.

## Properties
By definition, the only sets in the indiscrete topology that are [open]({{< ref open_sets.md >}}) are $X$ and $\emptyset$, and these are also the only [closed sets]({{< ref closed_sets.md >}}).
