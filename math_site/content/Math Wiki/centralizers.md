## Definitions
Let $(G, \cdot)$ be a [group]({{< ref groups.md >}}) with a [subgroup]({{< ref subgroups.md >}}) $H$. The **centralizer of the subgroup** $H$ in $G$, denoted $C(H)$, is the set of elements of $G$ that commute with all elements of $H$. That is, $C(H) = \{g \in G \mid gh = hg \,\, \forall h \in H\}$. For an element $x \in G$, the **centralizer of the element** $x$ in $G$, denoted $C(x)$ is the set of elements of $G$ that commute with the element $x$. That is, $C(x) = \{g \in G \mid gx = xg\}$.

## Properties
Let $G$ be a group with $H < G$ and $x \in G$. Then both $C(H)$ and $C(x)$ are subgroups of $G$. 

If $G$ is an [abelian]({{< ref abelian.md >}}) group, then both kinds of centralizers are just the whole group $G$. 

**Proposition:** If $\langle g \rangle$, the [cyclic subgroup]({{< ref cyclic.md >}}) generated by $g \in G$, is [normal]({{< ref normal_subgroups.md >}}) in $G$, then $C(g)$ is also normal in $G$.

## Examples
In [$D_4$]({{< ref dihedral.md >}}), the centralizer of $\{e,r^2\}$ is $C(\{e, r^2\}) = D_4$ (and in general the centralizer of the center is the whole group). We also have that the centralizer of the element $r$ is $C(r) = \{e, r, r^2, r^3\}$, since these are the elements that commute with $r$. This subgroup is normal in $D_4$ because $\langle r \rangle$ is normal in $G$.
