Also called **$T_2$-spaces**.

## Definition
Let $(X, \T)$ be a [topological space]({{< ref topology_def.md >}}). It is **Hausdorff** if and only if for every pair of distinct points $x$ and $y$, there exist disjoint [open sets]({{< ref open_sets.md >}}) $U$ and $V$ such that $x \in U$ and $y \in V$.

## Properties
[Theorem 4.7:](\work.pdf#page=31) If a space $(X, \T)$ is [$T_3$]({{< ref t3.md >}}), or [$T_4$]({{< ref t4.md >}}), it is also Hausdorff and therefore also [$T_1$]({{< ref t1.md >}}).

[Theorem 4.16:](\work.pdf#page=35)) The product of Hausdorff spaces is product, even for a possibly uncountable product.
