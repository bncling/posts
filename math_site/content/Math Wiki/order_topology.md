## Definition
Let $X$ be a set [totally ordered]({{< ref orderings.md >}}) by a relation $\leq$.  The **order topology** on $X$ is the [topology]({{< ref topology_def.md >}}) generated by the [basis]({{< ref basis.md >}}) $\B$ where $\B$ is the collection of subsets of $X$ of the form $\{x \in X \mid x < a\}$, $\{x \in X \mid a < x\}$, or $\{x \in X \mid a < x < b\}$ for $a, b \in X$.

## Properties
If $X$ is a set [totally ordered]({{< ref orderings.md >}}) by a relation $\leq$, then the order topology on $X$ has a [subbasis]({{< ref subbasis.md >}}) $\Sub$ containing sets of the form $\{x \in X \mid x < a\}$ or $\{x \in X \mid a < x\}$.

## Examples
[Exercise 3.19:](\work.pdf#page=24) The set $\R$ is totally ordered by the relation $\leq$, and $\R$ with the order topology is the [standard topology]({{< ref standard_topology.md >}}). 

The unit square $[0,1] \times [0,1]$ is totally ordered by the [lexicographic order]({{< ref orderings.md >}}), and the [lexicographically ordered square]({{< ref lex_square.md >}}) is the topological space formed from the unit square together with the associated order topology.
