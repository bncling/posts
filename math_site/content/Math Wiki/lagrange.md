## Statement
Let $(G, \cdot)$ be a finite [group]({{< ref groups.md >}}) and let $H$ be a [subgroup]({{< ref subgroups.md >}}) of $G$. Then $\vert G \vert = [G:H] \vert H \vert$, and therefore the order of $H$ divides the order of $G$.

## Proof
Since the [cosets]({{< ref grp_cosets.md >}}) of $H$ in $G$ partition $G$ into $[G:H]$ disjoint subsets, all of which have the same size, we have that $$G = \bigsqcup_{\text{distinct cosets } H_i} H_i \implies \vert G \vert = \sum_{\text{distinct cosets } H_i} \vert H_i \vert = [G:H] \vert H \vert. \quad \square$$

## Corollaries 
Let $G$ be a finite group with $g \in G$. Then the order of the element $g$ divides the order of the group $G$ becuase the [cyclic subgroup]({{< ref cyclic.md >}}) generated by $g$ has the same order as $g$ itself, and since it is a subgroup its order divides $\vert G \vert$ by Lagrange's Theorem.

If the order of $G$ is a [prime number]({{< ref prime.md >}}), then $G$ is [cyclic]({{< ref cyclic.md >}}) and all non-identity elements are generators.
