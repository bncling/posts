## Definition
A **subgroup** of a [group]({{< ref groups.md >}}) $(G,\cdot)$ is a subset $H \subset G$ such that $(H, \cdot)$ is a group under the same operation as $G$. We write $H < G$ if $H$ is a subgroup of $G$.

## Properties
The sets $\{e\}$ and $G$ are subgroups of $G$ for all groups $G$. Subgroups that are not $\{e\}$ are called **nontrivial**, and subgroups that are not $G$ are called **proper** subgroups.

**Theorem:** A subset $H$ of $G$ is a subgroup if and only if 

- the identity of $G$ is in $H$, that is, $e \in H$,
- $H$ is closed under the group operation, that is, $a,b \in H \implies ab \in H$, and
- elements in $H$ have their inverses in $H$, that is, $h \in H \implies h\inv \in H$.

**Theorem:** A non-empty subset $H$ of $G$ is a subgroup if and only if $a,b \in H$ implies that $ab\inv \in H$.

If $H$ and $K$ are subgroups of $G$, then $H \cap K$ is a subgroup. 

## Examples

For any group $(G, \cdot)$, and element $g \in G$, there is a subgroup called the **cyclic subgroup** of $G$ generated by $g$, given by $$ \langle g \rangle = \{g^k \mid k \in \Z\}. $$ As the name suggests, this subgroup is [cyclic]({{< ref cyclic.md >}}) with generator $g$. It is the smallest subgroup of $G$ that contains $g$, since by the Theorem above, any subgroup of $G$ containing $g$ contains all powers of $g$.

The [dihedral]({{< ref dihedral.md >}}) group $D_3$ has nontrivial, proper subgroups $\{e,r,r^2\}$, $\{e,f\}$, $\{e,fr\}$, and $\{e,fr^2\}$.
