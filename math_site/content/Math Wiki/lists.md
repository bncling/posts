## Definition
Let $n$ be a nonnegative integer. Then a **list of length $n$** is an ordered collection of $n$ objects, $(x_1, \dots, x_n)$.

For $j \in \{1, \dots, n\}$, we call the element $x_j$ the **$j$th coordinate** of the list.

## Properties
Two lists  are equal if and only if they have the same length and the same coordinates in the same order. That is $(x_1, \dots, x_n) = (y_1, \dots, y_m)$ if and only if $n = m$ and $x_j = y_j$ for all $j = 1, \dots, n$.

## Examples
We call lists of length $n = 2$ **ordered pairs**, and lists of length $n = 3$ **ordered triples**.

The empty list $()$ is also a list.
