## Definition
Let $(X,\T)$ be a [topological space]({{< ref topology_def.md >}}) with an [equivalence relation]({{< ref equiv_rels.md >}}) $\sim$ on $X$ such that $x \sim y$ if and only if there is a [path connected]({{< ref path_connectedness.md >}}) subset of $X$ that contains both $x$ and $y$. 

## Examples
The path components of the [closure]({{< ref closure.md >}}) of the [topologist's sine curve]({{< ref top_sine.md >}}) are the sine curve itself and the set $\{(0,y) \mid y \in [-1,1]\}$.
